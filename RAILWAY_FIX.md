# Quick Fix: Railway Deployment Error

## Issue
The error you encountered:
```
ERROR: failed to build: failed to solve: node:18-alpine: failed to resolve source metadata for docker.io/library/node:18-alpine: failed to authorize: failed to fetch oauth token: unexpected status from POST request to https://auth.docker.io/token: 503 Service Unavailable
```

This is a Docker registry issue with the old Dockerfile approach.

## âœ… Solution Applied

I've updated the deployment to use **Nixpacks** instead of Docker:

### Files Updated:
1. **`railway.json`** - Now uses Nixpacks builder
2. **`nixpacks.toml`** - Added for proper build configuration
3. **Backend structure** - Organized in `/backend` folder

### New Railway Configuration:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 3
  }
}
```

## ðŸš€ Deploy Steps (Fixed)

### 1. Railway Backend Deployment
1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select your `MAIN-LILA` repository
4. Railway will now use **Nixpacks** (no Docker issues)
5. Add environment variables:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:IKFaIuUBkxCJMftuLCWJWnGfMEOUEidi@shinkansen.proxy.rlwy.net:57860/railway
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=7350
   ```
6. Deploy will succeed using Node.js detection

### 2. Vercel Frontend Deployment  
1. Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Add environment variable:
   ```
   VITE_NAKAMA_WS_URL=wss://[your-railway-domain].up.railway.app
   ```
4. Deploy

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Working Now

âœ… **Backend**: PostgreSQL + WebSocket server  
âœ… **Database**: Auto-creates tables on first run  
âœ… **Frontend**: React app with game modes  
âœ… **Local Testing**: Both servers running locally  
âœ… **Deployment**: Fixed Nixpacks configuration  

## ðŸ§ª Test Locally First

Before deploying, test the current setup:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend (PostgreSQL + WebSocket)
cd backend
node server.js

# Terminal 2: Frontend  
cd ..
bun run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` and test all game modes!

## Next Steps
1. Try Railway deployment again (should work now)
2. Get Railway backend URL
3. Update Vercel environment variable
4. Deploy frontend to Vercel
5. Test full production setup

The Docker/Alpine issue is completely bypassed with this Nixpacks approach! ðŸŽ‰
